This metric helps users understand the bot's trading bias and strategy, whether it tends to favor long positions, short positions, or maintains a balanced approach. By examining the distribution, users can gain insights into the bot's market perspective and adjust their strategies accordingly to align with their trading goals and market conditions.</p> <p>Some trading strategies are designed to execute only buy trades, focusing on accumulating assets rather than selling them. It is perfectly normal to see only buy trades in such strategies, as they aim to capitalize on market opportunities by purchasing assets at favorable prices and holding them for potential future gains.</p>"},{"location":"manage_bot/#cagr","title":"CAGR %","text":"<p>The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) metric measures the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time longer than one year. It represents one of the most accurate ways to calculate and determine returns for anything that can rise or fall in value over time. By considering the effects of compounding, CAGR provides a smoothed annual rate of growth, offering a clear picture of the bot's performance and helping users compare it with other investments or benchmarks.</p> <p>To illustrate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), let's consider an example:</p> <p>Suppose you invested $10,000 in a trading bot at the beginning of 2020, and by the end of 2023, your investment has grown to $15,000. The CAGR can be calculated using the following formula:</p> \\[ \\text{CAGR} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Ending Value}}{\\text{Beginning Value}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} - 1 \\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>Ending Value = $15,000</li> <li>Beginning Value = $10,000</li> <li>\\( n \\) = number of years (3 years in this case)</li> </ul> <p>Plugging in the values:</p> \\[ \\text{CAGR} = \\left( \\frac{15,000}{10,000} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} - 1 \\] \\[ \\text{CAGR} = \\left( 1.5 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} - 1 \\] \\[ \\text{CAGR} \\approx 0.1447 \\text{ or } 14.47\\% \\] <p>This means that the trading bot achieved an average annual growth rate of approximately 14.47% over the 3-year period. The CAGR provides a smoothed annual rate of growth, allowing you to compare the bot's performance with other investments or benchmarks.</p> <p>By understanding the CAGR, you can better evaluate the long-term performance of your trading bot and make more informed investment decisions.</p>"},{"location":"manage_bot/#sharpe-ratio","title":"Sharpe Ratio","text":"<p>The Sharpe Ratio is a measure used to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of an investment or trading strategy. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the bot's return and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of the bot's returns. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates that the bot is generating better returns for each unit of risk taken, making it a valuable metric for assessing the efficiency and performance of the trading bot in relation to its risk exposure.</p> <p>To better understand the Sharpe Ratio, let's consider an example:</p> <p>Suppose your trading bot has an annual return of 15%, and the risk-free rate (such as the return on a 10-year government bond) is 2%. The standard deviation of the bot's returns, which measures the volatility or risk, is 10%.</p> <p>The Sharpe Ratio is calculated as follows:</p> \\[ \\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Return} - \\text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\\text{Standard Deviation}} \\] <p>Plugging in the values:</p> \\[ \\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{15\\% - 2\\%}{10\\%} = \\frac{13\\%}{10\\%} = 1.3 \\] <p>A Sharpe Ratio of 1.3 indicates that the bot is generating 1.3 units of return for each unit of risk taken. Generally, a Sharpe Ratio above 1 is considered good, above 2 is very good, and above 3 is excellent. This metric helps you assess whether the returns of your bot are worth the risks taken.</p>"},{"location":"manage_bot/#calmar-ratio","title":"Calmar Ratio","text":"<p>The Calmar Ratio is a metric used to evaluate the risk-adjusted performance of a trading strategy by comparing the average annual compounded return to the maximum drawdown. It helps investors understand how well the trading bot performs relative to the risk it takes, with a higher Calmar Ratio indicating better risk-adjusted returns.</p> <p>To calculate the Calmar Ratio, use the following formula:</p> \\[ \\text{Calmar Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{CAGR}}{\\text{Max Drawdown}} \\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>CAGR is the Compound Annual Growth Rate.</li> <li>Max Drawdown is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough.</li> </ul> <p>Let's consider an example to illustrate the Calmar Ratio:</p> <p>Suppose your trading bot has a CAGR of 14.47% (as calculated in the previous example) and a Max Drawdown of 20%.</p> <p>The Calmar Ratio is calculated as follows:</p> \\[ \\text{Calmar Ratio} = \\frac{14.47\\%}{20\\%} = 0.7235 \\] <p>A Calmar Ratio of 0.7235 indicates that for every unit of risk (as measured by the Max Drawdown), the bot generates approximately 0.7235 units of return. Generally, a higher Calmar Ratio is preferred, as it signifies better performance relative to the risk taken.</p> <p>By understanding the Calmar Ratio, you can better assess the risk-adjusted performance of your trading bot and make more informed decisions about its strategy.</p>"},{"location":"manage_bot/#open-trades-list","title":"Open Trades List","text":"<p>The Open Trades table offers a dynamic snapshot of your bot's active positions, empowering you to stay on top of your trading activities.</p> <p>The Open Trades table includes Trade ID, Symbol (Pair), Stake Amount, Current Price, and Open Date/Time.
