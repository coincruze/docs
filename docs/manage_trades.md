## Trade Actions Toolbar

The Trade Actions toolbar is available only for open trades.

### Reload

The reload action is used to refresh and update the latest information about the trade from the exchange. This ensures that the most current data is available for analysis.

### Force Exits

The Force Exit Limit feature enables closing a trade by placing a limit order at a specified price, ensuring the trade is exited only if the market reaches that price. The Force Exit Market feature facilitates closing a trade immediately at the current market price, providing a quick way to exit a position without waiting for a specific price level. Both options offer flexibility to manage trades promptly and effectively.

The Partial Exit option facilitates exiting only a portion of an open trade, rather than closing the entire position. This feature provides flexibility in managing trades by enabling locking in profits or reducing exposure incrementally, based on trading strategy and market conditions.
