### Exchange Specific Notes

Carefully review and follow these exchange-specific guidelines to ensure smooth bot operation and prevent potential trading interruptions.

#### Binance

When setting up Binance, users must be aware of several critical configurations.

**Select the correct Binance platform:**

- International users: Binance
- US-based users: Binance.US

**Futures Trading Requirements:**

- Binance has [complex futures quantitative trading rules](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/binance-futures-trading-quantitative-rules-4f462ebe6ff445d4a170be7d9e897272)
- Minimum stake amounts apply to prevent trading restrictions
- Mandatory settings:
    - Position Mode: Set to "One-way Mode"
    - Asset Mode: Set to "Single-Asset Mode"

!!! warning
    Failure to configure these settings will prevent bot activation

#### OKX

OKX requires an additional security step:

- Each API key must include a unique passphrase
- Ensure the passphrase is correctly entered into the `password` field during exchange configuration

#### Gate.io

Specific API key permissions on top of the market you want to trade are crucial for Gate.io:

- Required Permissions:
    * "Spot Trade" or "Perpetual Futures" (Read and Write) (either select both, or the one matching the market you want to trade)
    * "Wallet" (Read only)
    * "Account" (Read only)

!!! warning
    Incomplete permissions will prevent bot functionality

#### Bybit

Futures trading on Bybit demands precise API configurations:

- API Key Permissions:
    * Read-write access
    * Contract - Orders
    * Contract - Positions

!!! danger
    Coincruze operates under the assumption that each account is exclusively allocated to a single bot. Therefore, we advise assigning a separate subaccount for each bot, particularly when dealing with unified accounts.

!!! warning
    Alternative setups — such as running multiple bots on a single account or executing manual (non-bot) trades within a bot-operated account — are not supported and could result in unpredictable behavior.

#### BitMart

Bitmart mandates that the API key Memo (the label assigned to the API key) be provided alongside the exchange key and secret.
Enter the memo into `Api key` field.

Additionally, Bitmart requires Verification Level 2 to trade on the spot market via the API.
